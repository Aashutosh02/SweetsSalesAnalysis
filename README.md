## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps analyze the sales performance of chocolate products. It enables stakeholders to identify popular products, customer preferences, and trends over time. Through sales data, the dashboard highlights areas for improving marketing strategies, optimizing inventory, and understanding customer demographics.


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load Chocolate Sales Data: Specify that the data contains fields relevant to the sales of chocolates (e.g., sales by product type, region, customer segmentation, etc.).
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : Data Cleansing: Modify steps regarding data quality checks to address fields such as sales revenue, product category, and customer demographics.
- Step 5 : Visual Filters: Change the visual filters to reflect chocolate sales categories. Filters could include "Product Type," "Region," "Customer Demographics," and "Time Period."

# Visuals

Adjust visuals to reflect the chocolate sales context:

- Sales Breakdown: Replace the satisfied/unsatisfied customer visuals with:

Bar Chart: Breakdown of sales by product type or region.
Pie Chart: Proportion of sales by category (e.g., dark chocolate, milk chocolate, etc.).
- Sales Metrics:

Use card visuals to display key metrics like Total Sales, Average Order Value, Number of Customers, and Total Units Sold.
- Time-Based Metrics:

Use line charts or bar charts to visualize sales trends over time (e.g., monthly or quarterly sales performance).
- Demographics & Preferences:

If applicable, visualize customer demographics (age, gender) with bar charts to show which groups are purchasing the most chocolates.
Use a segmented chart to show customer preferences for different chocolate types.
- Geographical Data:

If you have location data, consider adding a map visual to highlight sales performance across different regions.
- KPIs:

Update your KPIs to reflect sales performance indicators such as Top-Selling Products, Sales by Region, and Sales by Customer Type.-
